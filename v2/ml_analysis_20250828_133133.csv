18341898190161763,"No, soda, whether regular or diet, is unlikely to effectively stave off hunger and may even contribute to increased food intake. 
Here's why:
Regular soda (sugar-sweetened)
Fructose and Satiety Signals: Regular soda is often sweetened with high-fructose corn syrup, which, unlike glucose, doesn't effectively trigger the release of satiety hormones that tell your brain you're full.
Insulin Spike: The rapid surge of insulin triggered by high-fructose corn syrup can signal your brain to eat more 1/2",qmgraves,2025-08-10 17:21:36+00:00,https://www.threads.com/@qmgraves/post/DNLsTbLgp2-,TEXT_POST,,500.0,True,False,,no,negative,0.92,random_forest,0.92,0.07,0.01,negative,0.8380929922732469,svm,0.8380929922732469,0.08637826985174181,0.07552873787501144,negative,0.8438766579588314,naive_bayes,0.8438766579588314,0.07801384526825139,0.07810949677291672,negative,0.8311604494334376,logistic_regression,0.8311604494334376,0.08486818593186424,0.08397136463469826,negative,0.92,random_forest,0.01,0.92,0.07
