Here's why:
Regular soda (sugar-sweetened)
Fructose and Satiety Signals: Regular soda is often sweetened with high-fructose corn syrup, which, unlike glucose, doesn't effectively trigger the release of satiety hormones that tell your brain you're full.
Insulin Spike: The rapid surge of insulin triggered by high-fructose corn syrup can signal your brain to eat more 1/2",qmgraves,2025-08-10 17:21:36+00:00,https://www.threads.com/@qmgraves/post/DNLsTbLgp2-,TEXT_POST,,500.0,True,False,,no,negative,0.92,random_forest,0.92,0.07,0.01,negative,0.8380929922732469,svm,0.8380929922732469,0.0863782698517418,0.0755287378750114,negative,0.8438766579588314,naive_bayes,0.8438766579588314,0.0780138452682513,0.0781094967729167,negative,0.794325285203759,logistic_regression,0.794325285203759,0.10346870213775548,0.10220601265848553,negative,0.92,random_forest,0.01,0.92,0.07,negative,0.9986848037786401,ensemble,gradient_boosting,0.00012518316487894485,0.9986848037786401,0.0011900130564809995,0.6190476190476191,0.8871307709361499,linear,logistic_regression,0.7619047619047619,0.725063607017706
