18072660062086318,"Processed Sugar medically and scientifically does the opposite and creates hunger pains so you buy the Doritos to go with the Pepsi. 

Processed sugars can lead to increased hunger because they provide empty calories that do not satisfy the body's nutritional needs, often resulting in cravings for more food. Additionally, high sugar intake can disrupt hormones that regulate appetite, making you feel hungrier.
