Fructose and Satiety Signals: Regular soda is often sweetened with high-fructose corn syrup, which, unlike glucose, doesn't effectively trigger the release of satiety hormones that tell your brain you're full.
Insulin Spike: The rapid surge of insulin triggered by high-fructose corn syrup can signal your brain to eat more 1/2",qmgraves,2025-08-10 17:21:36+00:00,https://www.threads.com/@qmgraves/post/DNLsTbLgp2-,TEXT_POST,,500.0,TRUE,FALSE,,no

18072660062086318,"Processed Sugar medically and scientifically does the opposite and creates hunger pains so you buy the Doritos to go with the Pepsi. 

Processed sugars can lead to increased hunger because they provide empty calories that do not satisfy the body's nutritional needs, often resulting in cravings for more food. Additionally, high sugar intake can disrupt hormones that regulate appetite, making you feel hungrier.

So you can make 7 liters of strong sugar water.  Also, a lemon is $0.52, pure lemon juice can be as cheap as $0.06 an ounce.
